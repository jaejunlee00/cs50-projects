            Haru Sushi, originally Hanabi, means "Spring." Just as its name suggests, Haru Sushi serves very fresh nigiri and sashimi.

            Overall, their sushi menus and kitchen menus are great. They have an outstanding quality of sake toro, madai, and uni. If you are a party of 5 or above, you can order a "boat" that is literally an wooden boat with all kinds of sushi and sashimi on board. Their don katsu and spicy seafood soup are also great dishes you don't want to miss.
