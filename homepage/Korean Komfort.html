            They started their business as a food truck and kicked off a restaurant in two locations in Austin, Texas. What's fascinating about this place is that the owners and chefs are not Korean, but they still cook traditional Korean dishes so well that everyone loves it.
            They are also well-known for Korean chicken wings that come as origianl, sweet and spicy, or soy and garlic. Whenever I watch sports with my friends I would always grab some chicken wings and make our sports moment more entertaining.
