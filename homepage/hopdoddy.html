            Hopdoddy is one of the most famous burger restaurant in Austin, Texas. Unlike fastfood burgers, they serve a high quality burger with organic vegetables, prime buns, and angus beef. You can choose how you want your beef to be cooked just like steak restaurants and a side of french fries.
            The price is somewhat expensive for a burger, but I see these as authentic entree rather than a "burger" so it's worth the price.
